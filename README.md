### AWS Routing ###

AWS makes routing simple by abstracting the complex configuration required when configuring hardware routers, and only requiring users of the platform to manage simple routing tables with a few fields. AWSâ€™ underlying infrastructure handles the rest. That being said, there are still several different options for routing which need to be considered and then configured, based on the size and complexity of your AWS environment.
